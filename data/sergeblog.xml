			<title>Everyday tech tends to stick around...</title>
			<description>John Brandon writes in TechRadar about &lt;a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/8-bits-of-everyday-tech-we-won-t-use-in-a-decade-639465?artc_pg=2"&gt;tech we won't use in a decade&lt;/a&gt;. It's an interesting read, and some predictions seem fairly safe, but overall I don't think the times are moving that fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were already using computers a lot in 1999, the striking thing is how little things have changed since then. Maybe we weren't online all the time, but basically we used our computers in much the same way. Web-based email, IM, photo editing, computer-based video editing, etc. all existed and worked reasonably well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I don't deny that things are improving. Syncing files between computer used to be a huge pain, and now it's just a little pain. Sharing things online is a lot easier. A home network can now be set up in less than  two weeks, and it can be expected to actually work. Laptops are thinner and batteries last longer. Backupping cell-phone data on a computer isn't reserved to top coders and mad scientists anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, despite numerous predictions to the contrary, the keyboard is still there, the mouse is still there, and the basic concept of the general-purpose personal computer is still very much alive. I really doubt that this will change substantially in as little as a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there's definitely one thing missing from the list: TV as we know it, with 100+ channels broadcasting lukewarm reruns 24h/day and a business model that requires people to tune in at 8:25 and not leave the room during commercials. There's no way &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; can survive another ten years.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7794980101972071820-7738730836745313642?l=sboucher.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

			<title>Just In: Tasty Food Keeps You Thin</title>
			<description>While roaming the web for news bits on the health-care reform debate in the US (which can be &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_08/019423.php"&gt;hysterically funny&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/article.cgi?article=322"&gt;very&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://imgur.com/ErvaP.jpg"&gt;sad&lt;/a&gt;, often &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/08/10/ibd-hawking"&gt;simultaneously&lt;/a&gt;) I stumbled upon a &lt;a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/10/20/2789777.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on various health care statistics in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD"&gt;OECD&lt;/a&gt; countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the most interesting part of this report was the last graph, which charts obesity levels across countries. These seem to inverse-correlate perfectly with how good I find the food there. The thinnest countries are those with either superb meat and produce (Switzerland), awesome cuisine (France), or both (Japan). The fattest are those where good food seems rare and wicked expensive (the UK and US).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this is just my own perception, but how great would it be if there was some general law hidden in there, so that each time you had a really good meal, you could tell yourself that in all likelihood it must also have been really healthy?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7794980101972071820-538484807309634619?l=sboucher.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

			<title>Black Holes are Kewwwwl</title>
			<description>Scientists at the Israel Institute of Technology managed to &lt;a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2009/06/17/sonic-black-hole.html"&gt;create&lt;/a&gt; an acoustic black hole. This is pretty neat in and of itself, but the real value lies in prompting &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; to make &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/06/5-audio-atrocities-to-throw-down-a-sonic-black-hole/"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/07/black-hole-games/"&gt;those&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/07/black-hole-gadgets/"&gt;lists&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/07/blackholescience/"&gt;things&lt;/a&gt; they want to throw at it ;-)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7794980101972071820-6032223024682504885?l=sboucher.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

			<title>When in doubt, shout louder</title>
			<description>I've heard many people say confidently that even in doubt, it's better to act overconfident, because :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who knows, maybe you're right.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;If not, by the time people find out, they'll have forgotten all about you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even those who remember will eventually forgive you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nobody trusts honest, nuanced, fact-based and qualified opinions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this statement is now supported by honest, nuanced, fact-based and qualified &lt;a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2009/0620/1224249169532.html" title="Un-humble opinions - The Irish Times - Sat, Jun 20, 2009"&gt;scientific&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227115.500-humans-prefer-cockiness-to-expertise.html" title="Humans prefer cockiness to expertise - life - 10 June 2009 - New Scientist"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7794980101972071820-1289272900534842514?l=sboucher.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

			<title>What's in the bag?</title>
			<description>This morning I had the privilege of speaking at the &lt;a href="http://geowebconference.org/" title="GeoWeb 2009 Conference â€“ Cityscapes"&gt;GeoWeb&lt;/a&gt; conference in sunny Vancouver. The conference looks again very promising, but that is not my subject today. Rather, I am writing about what I did before arriving in Vancouver: just to make this trip a bit more challenging, I decided to fly in a little early, visit Seattle and Victoria, go hiking in Olympic National Park, and try to take a few interesting pictures along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've ever done any backpacking, you might spot a little logistics challenge here: I need enough photo gear for serious pictures, enough camping gear to survive a few days in the wild, and clothes that won't look entirely out of place at the conference. Obviously I'll be flying in and out, and once there I'll travel only on foot and public transport, as I'm allergic to cars, so I can't take more than I can comfortably carry on my back for days on end. Not trivial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is my solution: everything I'm packing plus the bags I'm carrying it in, photographed and listed in no particular order. If you've ever had to sit on your suitcase to close it, or felt miserable carrying too much stuff on a long trip, I hope you'll find a few useful things in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TxFbCzDMx9U/SnDOP633jyI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/4uHRfWbYyNo/s1600-h/IMG_0011e.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 207px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TxFbCzDMx9U/SnDOP633jyI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/4uHRfWbYyNo/s400/IMG_0011e.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5364013929095204642" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One body, two lenses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spare battery, charger&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;7x 4GB CF Cards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;2x 500GB portable hard drive&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laptop, USB hub, VGA and AC adapters&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cell phone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wallet, passport&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tripod with ball-head and leveling base&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Day pack: unpadded messenger bag (shown rolled)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleeping bag, liner, sleeping pad&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bivy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lots of garbage bags and ziplock bags&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tarp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;First aid kit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day" title="Towel Day - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"&gt;Towel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rope, compass, knife/multi-tool, &lt;a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/back-light.shtml" title="Back-Light"&gt;spork&lt;/a&gt;, headlamp, water purification tablets...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maps, guide book and Carl Sagan's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle-Dark/dp/0345409469" title="Amazon.com: The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark (9780345409461): Carl Sagan, Ann Druyan: Books"&gt;Demon-Haunted World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;2x water bottle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hiking outfit (shell pants + long-sleeved shirt)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Town outfit (Slightly classier pants + long-sleeved shirt. Although it doesn't look like one, this is technically also a hiking outfit, and is very comfortable in a variety of conditions.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spare long-sleeved shirt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Light socks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heavy socks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Underwear&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swimsuit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fleece top&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rain jacket&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rain pants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hiking shoes (not shown)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hiking poles (not shown)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Backpack to hold all of this in&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I am not listing exact model references because I think the general equipment choices are a lot more important than the precise models and brands bought. However, if anyone's interested in exactly what those items are and the rationale behind them I'll be glad to add that information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The backpack is a 75+10 liters model, definitely on the roomy side although larger ones certainly exist. On planes and city trips, the day pack holds my wallet, passport, photo gear and laptop, while everything else goes inside the backpack. While hiking, I'm using the trekking poles and the tripod gets lashed to the exterior of the backpack, freeing enough space to empty the day pack inside it and carry everything in reasonable comfort -- or at least that was the plan. I'll post a follow-up in a few days about how well it all worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'til then, I'll be thinking of my next &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Walk-Woods-Rediscovering-America-Appalachian/dp/0307279464/" title="Amazon.com: A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail (9780307279460): Bill Bryson: Books"&gt;walk in the woods&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7794980101972071820-2859287055423459451?l=sboucher.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

			<title>For web browsers, the future is now</title>
			<description>&lt;em&gt;Author's note: I just uncovered a draft of this post, which was written during Safari 4's public beta. It was almost finished, but for some reason I had forgotten all about it. Since it is just as (ir)relevant today as it was then, I'm publishing it now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I read this in a mail from Agile Web Solutions, makers of the beloved &lt;a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password" title="Password Manager + Automatic Form Filler for Mac OS X"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Last week Apple released a new Beta of Safari 4 and Iâ€™m blown away by how great it is! While it will take some time to get used to the new tabs, Iâ€™m very excited about the new features, especially the ability to resize images when zooming the page.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems every other year or so I hear someone gushing about how their favourite browser's new version sports some amazing innovative new feature, and each time it's something &lt;a href="http://www.opera.com/"&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt; has had since the nineties. There must be some kind of fundamental law at work here, and I am sure careful analysis of Opera's changelog would yield an accurate timetable of future "innovations" in other browsers. Obviously, "careful research" is way too much work for me, but this being a blog I am allowed to just make it all up. So today, I proudly present you with the future of web browsers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2010&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Safari now seamlessly saves open tabs on exit and restores them on restart&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;In Firefox, cmd-z reopens just-closed tabs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2011&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;At Macworld, Apple announces Safari will support mouse gestures "in a future version"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;Firefox drops the "you are about to close x open tabs" dialog box&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;The major browsers finally figure out the right implementation of History-Back on sites that use POST requests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2012&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Internet Explorer 9 has a "downloads" window that is not entirely useless&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;Safari now remembers which filetypes to open (and with which application) and which filetypes to save (and where)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;Firefox finds a way to save passwords without making them readable by anyone who happens to walk by the computer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2013&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All major browsers now support unified full-text search of bookmarks, history and the web, all from the address field&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;Internet Explorer gets keyboard navigation so good that using a mouse at all is entirely optional&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;Firefox gets auto-fill that works with more than one account per site&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;History in Safari becomes vaguely usable&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2014&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;IE's new popup blocker gives you more than .6 seconds to react when you *do* want a popup to open&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;Firefox now requires only three clicks to download all links from a web page (eg. an ftp index page)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;Safari offers bookmarks syncing across computers. For free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;And finally, circa 2029&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mozilla presents Firefox 17, the first version to require less than a dozen plug-ins to be any good&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7794980101972071820-4675196286697583963?l=sboucher.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

			<title>Top Ten Digital Photography Tips</title>
			<description>I've been meaning to write a list of "tips for better pictures" for a while, but this is about as good as it gets, so I think I'll pass:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://fyi.oreilly.com/2009/01/david-pogues-top-ten-tips-of-a.html"&gt;David Pogue's "Top Ten Tip of All Time" for Digital Photography&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My top three would be: get closer, force flash off in low light, force flash on under harsh sunlight. Obviously this list was meant for digicams, and some things change when one upgrades to a DSLR, so maybe I'll write up &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; list at some point.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7794980101972071820-4591149799049211511?l=sboucher.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

			<title>What camera should I buy?</title>
			<description>You're interested in photography, and you want to buy a serious camera that will not only take good pictures but also help you learn this craft and remain a useful tool as you improve. If you're the kind of person who absolutely has to know everything and can't stand to have anything but "the best", I suggest you go over &lt;a href="http://www.dpreview.com"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://photo.net"&gt;sites&lt;/a&gt;, read every single article they have and make your own opinion. On the other hand, if you have anything remotely approaching a life, you might be better of following the decision chart below. This way you'll chose your camera in three minutes, leaving you with all your remaining life minus 180 seconds to actually learn to take great photos â€” a much more rewarding experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TxFbCzDMx9U/SZGTy2lje2I/AAAAAAAAAF4/lkCmJI-lUBg/s1600-h/buying_guide.png"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 206px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TxFbCzDMx9U/SZGTy2lje2I/AAAAAAAAAF4/lkCmJI-lUBg/s400/buying_guide.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5301180738247555938" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(*) "passionate" really is terribly inappropriate here, but I couldn't think of a better word, so please indulge me in redefining this term for the sake of this chart. What I mean by someone being "passionate" is that he's the kind of photographer who would benefit from owning lots of gear, and is motivated enough that one day he will. By that definition, Henri-Cartier Bresson was *not* a passionate photographer. Rather fittingly, he rarely used Canon nor Nikon cameras. In case you're in doubt, if you answer "yes" to any or all of the following questions, you're probably "passionate":&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You fully expect that at some point in the future you'll own more than three lenses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're interested in technically challenging photography, e.g.: concert photography, (indoor) sports, wildlife, birds, all of the above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You plan vacations to maximise photographic opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You'd like to try taking unusual photos, e.g. of very small objects or with Fisheye or Tilt/Shift lenses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You actually know what Fisheye and T/S lenses are, or if you don't you plan on looking them up on Google as soon as you're done here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here it is! If you're currently on the market for your first (serious) camera I hope you find this chart useful. If you've already made that decision and have anything to say about any of the above, I'd really like to hear from you. In both cases, the comment form is there for you. Enjoy!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7794980101972071820-1946738375958733469?l=sboucher.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

			<description>New programming Language!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Name: Fortress&lt;br /&gt;Developer: Sun Microsystems&lt;br /&gt;Aim: kill Fortran (and good riddance)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The Fortress language incorporates a mathematical syntax, meaning that mathematic symbols are operators and can be used to write a program. As a result, mathematical operations look exactly the same in the code as they would as they do in the mathematical textbooks, or on the professors' whiteboards.[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortress features both implicit and explicitly parallelism, Flood said. Unlike every other programming language, Fortress assumes that the functions you write can run in parallel. A programmer has to specify when this is not the case. It will also divvy out work among multiple processors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]units of measurements are types, assuring that no mistakes will be made multiplying, say, kilometers with miles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gcn.com/blogs/tech/46231.html"&gt;http://www.gcn.com/blogs/tech/46231.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7794980101972071820-8446293012528931153?l=sboucher.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

			<title>Ten Signs You Want to Be a "Serious" Photographer</title>
			<description>I know those &amp;quot;Ten Things&amp;quot; lists can get pretty lame, but I couldn't find any like this one, and I thought it would be an easy way to conclusively prove to my esteemed readers that I am, indeed, slightly mad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have a special B&amp;amp;H wishlist just for camera bags.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You chose your whole camera system in a week and never looked back, but four years later you're still looking for the right tripod.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You sort national parks in preferred visiting order.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;During holidays, you get up three hours earlier than on working days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You don't understand why anyone would buy a car when they could get a 600/4.0 for the same price.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You don't see anything ridiculous in staying in the exact same spot for forty minutes waiting for the light to improve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You consider anyone who doesn't know about adjustment layers technologically illiterate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You think of your laptop mainly as a Portable Storage Device.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You refer to your travel companions as &amp;quot;interesting compositional elements&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;And, last but not least, you get &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; sick of hearing &amp;quot;Wow. You must have a really good camera&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7794980101972071820-1712511100554744144?l=sboucher.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

			<title>Tact Filter</title>
			<description>An interesting theory about &lt;a href="http://www.43folders.com/2007/09/24/jeff-biglers-tact-filter-theory"&gt;tact filters&lt;/a&gt; has been mentioned on &lt;a href="http://www.43folders.com"&gt;43folders&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not sure this is about &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEzGIuY7kw"&gt;nerds&lt;/a&gt; vs normal people rather than simply different personality types. Many people seem both tactles &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; clueless, and still enjoy a very succesful social life.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7794980101972071820-2927460126609884580?l=sboucher.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

			<title>More Mac Utilities</title>
			<description>My latest post listed all the nifty little utilities and haxies I use to turn my Mac user interface into something funnier and more productive than what OS X gave me out of the box. Of course, having a great user interface to access your documents and applications isn't all that useful unless you also have top-notch tools to process these documents. The greatest application switcher in the world won't do you much good if the application you're switching to isn't all that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine is currently switching to the Mac, and asked me about what really great applications lurk in the Macintosh world. There happens to be quite a few of them, and because I'm such a nice guy, I decided to blog about those I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I'm great &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; ambitious, this will be a three-part series. In this post I'll talk about the small stuff: little utilities that aren't all that important but still help in some way. The next one will talk about the big, expensive stuff. In the last one I'll deal with the Dashboard widgets I like (that one will be pretty short).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've tried to put these in categories that make some kind of sense, but I'll freely admit it's a pretty weird kind. Let's start with system utilities first:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/download.shtml" title="iTerm: Download"&gt;iTerm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: this list has to start somewhere, so why not with an app that brings us back to the good ole' Unix days. There's nothing obviously wrong with Apple's Terminal, but iTerm looks a bit nicer, is more customizable, and it has &lt;strong&gt;tabs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://download.darwinports.com/" title="Download DarwinPorts"&gt;DarwinPorts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: OS X implementation of the &lt;em&gt;port&lt;/em&gt; package manager from Debian Linux. The command &amp;quot;port install python&amp;quot; will download the latest version of Python, as well as all its dependencies, then compile and install everything. It's one-click installs for unix software, and it Just Works. (Update: apparently new versions are called &lt;a href="http://www.macports.org/" title="MacPorts"&gt;MacPorts&lt;/a&gt; for some reason.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foldershare.com/"&gt;FolderShare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: this small dotcom startup, recently bought by Microsoft (who sadly doesn't seem to be doing anything with it) is a real gem. It allows you to synchronize folders between any number of computers (PCs, Macs, Linux boxes) across the internet. After setting up your account, you first download and install a small program, then all subsequent configuration happens through the web interface. It allows you to access any file on any currently connected computer, as well as setting &amp;quot;libraries&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;synchronized&amp;quot; folders. All file transfers are peer-to-peer, so performance is pretty good. The big sour point is that there's no mechanism to automatically reconcile conflicting changes, so if you edit the same file on two different computers, you get two versions of the file and it's your job to make sense of them. Still, I work on three different computers all the time, and this is the best way I've found to make the process reasonably seamless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the obligatory &amp;quot;productivity&amp;quot; utilities:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.smileonmymac.com/textexpander/download.html" title="TextExpander: Customizable Typing Utility Saves Time!"&gt;TextExpander&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: this is &lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt;. In many word processors you can set up &amp;quot;macros&amp;quot;, or one-word shortcuts for snippets of text you use over and over again. This is the same thing but it works system-wide. Especially useful for emails.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://growl.info/downloads.php" title="Growl Downloads"&gt;Growl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: many programs run in the background waiting for something to happen so they can tell you about it. &amp;quot;File transfer complete&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;annoying_jerk@hotmail.com wants to send you a file&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;You have 237 new mail messages&amp;quot;. etc. Usually this is stuff you want to know about, but maybe not &lt;strong&gt;right now&lt;/strong&gt;. Growl gives you a central place for all those notifications. When you're feeling bored you can set it up to warn you of everything all the time, but as soon as you feel like actually getting stuff done, it only takes one click to get him to shut up for the time being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/email_chat/twitterrific.html" title="Twitterrific - Email &amp;amp; Chat"&gt;Twitterific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/" title="Twitter: What are you doing?"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; client for Mac OS X, and with it you won't fail to waste all the time that the previous utilities saved you, and then some.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/" title="Synergy"&gt;Synergy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Software KVM. Nice when you have multiple computers in the same place. Works with Mac OS X, all versions of Windows, Linux. I've also tried &lt;a href="http://abyssoft.com/software/teleport/" title="Abyssoft Teleport"&gt;Teleport&lt;/a&gt;, which is more mac-like and can be installed without editing  obscure configuration files. On the flip side, it's Mac-only, and I could never get it to work...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's call the next ones &amp;quot;multimedia utilities&amp;quot;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flip4mac.com/download.htm" title="Flip4Mac - Downloads"&gt;Flip4Mac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: this allows you to play all (non-DRMed) Windows Media files in Quicktime and most web browsers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://stinkbot.com/Tubesock/" title="TubeSock - Save YouTube videos"&gt;TubeSock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: download files from YouTube, converts them to whatever you want (iPod, H.264, etc.) and add them to iTunes, all in one click. At $15 it's pricey, but much faster than free solutions out there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fadingred.org/senuti/"&gt;Senuti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: if you have an iPod, you want this. Allows you to transfer any music file from an iPod back to iTunes. It's a real shame that Apple's iTunes no longer does this out of the box, but as long as Senuti works I don't mind too much.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.roxio.com/eng/products/toast/titanium/overview.html" title="Roxio Toast 8 Titanium - CD &amp;amp; DVD Burning - Overview"&gt;Toast Titanium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the Mac's Nero. There's plenty of ways to burn CDs and DVDs from Mac OS itself, but Toast automatically splits data-sets that won't fit on a single disk, does one-click DVDs from most kinds of video and picture files, allows you to burn obscure formats like DVD-Audio, you name it. Slightly expensive for something you probably don&amp;apos;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need, but it's very good at what it does.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following utilities you probably won't use frequently, or at all, but it's good to know they exist:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnidisksweeper/" title="The Omni Group - Applications - OmniDiskSweeper"&gt;OmniDiskSweeper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: No matter how big your hard drive is, at one point it&amp;apos;ll get nearly full and you will have to delete some stuff. This (nearly-)free tool instantly shows you which files and folders take up the most space. (If you're a Unix geek you can think of it as &amp;quot;du -sh&amp;quot; with a GUI.) Very handy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.charlessoft.com/" title="CharlesSoft - software you always wished someone would write"&gt;Pacifist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Chances are you'll never use this. I didn't. But a friend of mine swears by it, and it looks like it might be the only way out in some situations, so I'll mention it anyway. It allows you to look inside .mpkg installation packages and select individual files to install. Automatic installers usually work fine, but, hey, you never know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cotvnc/" title="SourceForge.net: Chicken of the VNC"&gt;Chicken of the VNC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: VNC client. If you don't know what VNC is, you probably don't need it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Mac OS X is compatible with most of everything, and it's pretty rare to come upon a file that you can't open with what's in the default OS install. I've found two, and luckily there's free applications to handle both of them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.unrarx.com/" title="UnRarX - Mac OS X RAR Extraction Utility"&gt;UnRarX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; expands .rar archives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chmox.sourceforge.net/" title="Chmox - a Mac OS X CHM viewer"&gt;Chmox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; opens Microsoft's .chm files (Compiled Html) used for some documentation and ebooks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's it!  In my next post, I'll talk about bigger, and probably more controversial, software choices. See you soon.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7794980101972071820-3436904897254107684?l=sboucher.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

			<title>My Very Own Mac Desktop Interface</title>
			<description>The Mac has a &lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt; user-interface. Everybody knows that. No-one can ever explain exactly what it is that makes it so great, but it's great. Any sane person only has to use a Mac for a little while to realize how superior it is to every other GUI, even &lt;a href="http://sboucher.blogspot.com/2007/01/open-source-aeroqua.html"&gt;those he's never heard of&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.bumptop.com/"&gt;those that aren't really implemented yet&lt;/a&gt;. Some people may disagree, but that just means they're Windows fanboys and thus not worth listening to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, call me picky, but that perfection is just not good enough for me. And judging by the number of user-interface add-ons available for Mac OS X, I'm not alone. I've tweaked my Mac so much that it doesn't even &lt;strong&gt;look&lt;/strong&gt; like a Mac anymore, and that's not because the Mac is that bad. It's just that from my perspective it can still be improved quite a lot, and since there's plenty of ways to do exactly that, I did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing first: the Dock sucks. Interaction design guru &lt;a href="http://www.asktog.com"&gt;Tog&lt;/a&gt; wrote about &lt;a href="http://www.asktog.com/columns/044top10docksucks.html" title="Top 10 Reasons the Apple Dock Sucks"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; a while ago, and even though Tiger has improved a few things, most of his points still hold. The Dock is a low-density widget that only works well for someone who only ever uses the same five apps and three documents, and that's not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other big problem is that the Mac interface is made for multi-tasking. (If you don't find that self-evident, ask yourself why the green &amp;quot;Zoom&amp;quot; button doesn't actually zoom.) That's awesome when you're working on stuff that requires multi-tasking, like blogging or reading emails or brainstorming with a bunch of people in an IM session. However it's not so great when you need to finish a boring report, especially if you're me and you have the attention span of a ferret with ADD and a caffeine addiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence after using a Mac for a couple of months, I got annoyed at some of its GUI quirks and decided to do something about it. I quickly came upon an article by Tog called &lt;a href="http://www.asktog.com/columns/060MonsterMac.html" title="AskTog: Make Your Mac a Monster Machine"&gt;Make Your Mac a Monster Machine&lt;/a&gt;, and since then my Mac Desktop has changed forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays I refuse to settle for a single user interface. I have two. The one I use most of the time is optimized for multi-tasking, just like the original Mac Desktop, and looks like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TxFbCzDMx9U/RjYt41Ni9MI/AAAAAAAAAA0/OHd7goOSARI/s1600-h/my_desktop_mt.png"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TxFbCzDMx9U/RjYt41Ni9MI/AAAAAAAAAA0/OHd7goOSARI/s320/my_desktop_mt.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5059281685777151170" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other one I use when I need to focus on just one thing. It looks like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TxFbCzDMx9U/RjYt41Ni9NI/AAAAAAAAAA8/4dub92a9WTo/s1600-h/my_desktop_st.png"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_TxFbCzDMx9U/RjYt41Ni9NI/AAAAAAAAAA8/4dub92a9WTo/s320/my_desktop_st.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5059281685777151186" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you've tried this kind of setup before it probably looks stupid, but I've found it really helps me concentrate on what's really important for the work at hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To achieve this setup, I use a lot of different utilities and applications. Although I use all of them, there's no reason &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; have to, so I've decided to simply list them all and describe what they do. I guess most people will try them one at a time and figure out whether they work for them or not. So, without further ado, here's the list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://virtuedesktops.info/" title="VirtueDesktops"&gt;VirtueDesktops&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; If you've used Linux recently, you probably know what virtual desktops are and how useful they can be. VirtueDesktop is a pretty good implementation of the idea, and it's free. The two features I really like is first how easy it is to bind applications, forcing them to always stay on the desktop where they make the most sense (I've got Mail, iCal and Address Book bound to my "In" desktop.) and the wealth of keyboard and mouse triggers you can set up to go from one desktop to another or move applications around. This will likely be replaced by &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/spaces.html" title="Apple - Apple - Mac OS X - Leopard Sneak Peek - Spaces"&gt;Spaces&lt;/a&gt; once Leopard comes out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/" title="quicksilver: launching is a gateway drug"&gt;QuickSilver&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This thing is unbelievably cool. The first time you use it it looks like Just Another Application Launcher: hit &amp;#x2303;-space, iTunes, &amp;#x21A9; and iTunes appears. That's already pretty useful if you're a keyboard junkie, but when it comes to Quicksilver, launching is not so much scratching the surface as polishing it with a soft cloth. From its minimalist interface, Quicksilver allows you to open documents with any app, navigate the filesystem, create folders, move and copy files. It also comes with a wealth of plug-ins that allows for FTP upload, controlling iTunes, creating iCal appointments, reading your address book, searching Google, and pretty much everything you can think off, all in just a few keystrokes. After using it for a few days, you won't believe how you ever managed without it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most "power-users" think the mouse is inherently inefficient and that you can be a lot faster with keyboard shortcuts. This is mostly true, but for some tasks the mouse feels a lot more natural, and with a well-designed interface it can be mighty fast, too. The next four utilities make launching and switching between applications with a mouse much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dragthing.com/" title="The Official DragThing Home Page"&gt;DragThing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a bit like the dock, except it is better in all possible ways. It can store hundreds of applications, documents or urls in a fraction of the Dock's footprint. Best of all, it puts them in predictable places, which makes finding them with a mouse a lot faster. As an added bonus, you get a nice trash can in the bottom right corner of the screen, which is a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; faster to access than the dock's.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://vercruesse.de/software/asm" title="vercruesse | de"&gt;Application Switcher Menu&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This is just like the Applications menu from OS 9. It sits in the top right corner corner of your screen and shows all your open applications. With a single click you can switch to an app, quit it or hide it, without ever touching the keyboard. It's especially useful with VirtueDesktop, since Expose only shows Apps from the current desktop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://unsanity.com/haxies/wsx" title="[unsanity] WindowShade X - Collapse, Minimize-In-Place your windows and more!"&gt;WindowShadeX&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This is another haxie that revives a nice feature of OS9. It gives two new behaviours to all your windows: WindowShade, which rolls up the window inside it's title bar, and minimize-in-place, which shrinks it on the side of your desktop. Both are very handy when you have many windows open on a small screen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.donelleschi.com/stickywindows/" title="Donelleschi Software :: Sticky Windows (New) :: Features"&gt;StickyWindows&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; I found out about this one only a few days ago, and I'm starting to like it even though it's a bit redundant with WindowShade. It allows you to minimize windows into tabs and &amp;quot;stick&amp;quot; them on you screen's edges. By default these tabs are &amp;quot;automatic&amp;quot;, meaning that whenever a stuck windows looses focus it minimizes to its tab, keeping screen clutter to a minimum.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a small hint: if you install the previous four applications, you'll quickly notice that you never use the dock anymore and it's just taking space there for no reason. Luckily, it can be totally hidden from view, even though the feature isn't well-documented. Just open up a terminal window and type these commands:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ defaults write com.apple.dock launchanim -bool no&lt;br /&gt;$ defaults write com.apple.dock magnification -bool no&lt;br /&gt;$ defaults write com.apple.dock autohide -bool yes&lt;br /&gt;$ defaults write com.apple.dock orientation -string top&lt;br /&gt;$ defaults write com.apple.dock pinning -string end&lt;br /&gt;$ defaults write com.apple.dock tilesize -int 16&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then either log out and log back in or just force-quit the Finder. The dock is now hidden in the top-right corner, beneath the menu bar. If at one point you really need to see it again, hit &amp;#x2318;&amp;#x2325;D. More info &lt;a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040423170608616"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (By the way, don't you love operating systems that you can easily customize using undocumented NeXTStep commands that &lt;em&gt;Just Works&lt;/em&gt;? Never mind...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This takes care of my multi-tasking desktops. As said earlier, I also have a &amp;quot;single-tasking&amp;quot; (aka &lt;em&gt;sensory-deprived&lt;/em&gt;) desktop, inspired by &lt;a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/12/21/mb33-distracted-mac/"&gt;the distracted mac&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://www.twit.tv/MB"&gt;Macbreak&lt;/a&gt; podcast. This uses two more utilities:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/15426" title="Backdrop 1.4 - MacUpdate"&gt;Backdrop&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This just displays a uniform wallpaper above your desktop, hiding all your icons and other applications. Originally it was made for taking nice screenshots, but it works great as a focusing aid for the attention-challenged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/16640" title="MenuShade 1.1 - MacUpdate"&gt;MenuShade&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, you've got Backdrop running and your whole desktop is hidden. Suddenly that menu bar on top of the screen looks &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bright and it's kinda annoying. MenuShade allows you to dim it, either totally black or totally bright or anything in between. When you hover your mouse near the top it reverts to full brightness for best legibility. I set it to not quite black, so that when I'm looking at it I can still aim for the right menu, but the rest of the time it simply disappears.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've added those last two utilities to my Login Items, so they launch automatically when I turn the computer on. Using VirtueDesktop, I've bound them to my third desktop, which is called &amp;quot;Work in Progress&amp;quot;. This way I always get the same setup when I log in, with the usual interface, and when I need to concentrate on something, the sensory-deprived desktop is only a keystroke away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is it! A super-powerful user-interface explained in just a dozen paragraphs! Don't you wish everything was that simple ?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7794980101972071820-2120893908440735106?l=sboucher.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

			<title>Did Google want to be sued ?</title>
			<description>&lt;a href="http://www.michiknows.com/"&gt;Michi Knows&lt;/a&gt; has an interesting theory about how Viacom's lawsuit has always been part of Google's strategy in buying YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He raises many interesting ideas (&lt;a href="http://www.michiknows.com/2007/03/14/maybe-google-wanted-to-be-sued-youtube-and-plan-b/"&gt;Go read them !&lt;/a&gt; You can come back here afterwards :) ) but I believe the simplest explanation is usually the best, and I don't think you need to include the legal side to explain why Google bought youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google bought YouTube because it has a gazillion page views a day and is likely to grow enormously in years to come. This is the only thing that matters. Google's business is all about page views. Double the page views, double the revenue. It's that simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The legal threat from copyright holders doesn't matter much. You could ban all the TV content from YouTube and it would still be enormously popular. As of today, clips from the mainstream media are in the minority on YouTube. The most popular videos are user-generated. Those non-mainstream-media vids are getting better and better, because users are getting better at producing them, but also because serious producers from independent labels and small studios are realizing that YouTube is a great advertising medium, and indie artists are recognizing it, and MySpace, as great ways to be discovered. YouTube is all about distributing those kinds of videos, not television shows. (That's more iTunes' or &lt;a href="http://www.joost.com/"&gt;Joost&lt;/a&gt;'s business.) In the long run, YouTube doesn't even &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; the mainstream media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of today, Viacom wants a billion bucks. So what ? Google will negotiate a deal and this will never reach the courts. Why fight it out ? Google might win of course, even though Napster and Kazaa lost, and their business model was pretty close to YouTube's, but why bother ? Even a "win" would surely involve a court decision constraining Google/YouTube to do &lt;strong&gt;something&lt;/strong&gt; about piracy, and that would be expensive and technologically challenging. (Yes, even for Google.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, if what Viacom really wants is to kill YouTube plain and simple, then it will have to go to court. Maybe their faith in Joost goes so far that they're willing to sacrifice all the free publicity they get on YouTube and all the goodwill in the world just to cripple a competitor. Maybe. But for Google, maintaining the status quo is much simpler and less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are new distribution media and business models like YouTube's showing the need for a serious rehaul of copyright laws ? Certainly. But this is not Google's fight. The only thing they did was to buy a site with the potential for huge traffic, so that this traffic would be their own, not Yahoo's or Microsoft's. Of course they thought about the legal issues. But those are peripheral, not strategic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS: the latest &lt;a href="http://www.twit.tv/node/4946"&gt;TWiT&lt;/a&gt; discusses this subject at length.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7794980101972071820-7040529581459738369?l=sboucher.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

			<title>The Macintosh Keyboard</title>
			<description>I've just noticed that I've been writing this blog for a few months now, and I've never posted a proper tech rant. A "tech rant" is when a blogger gets up on a metaphorical podium with a decent piece of design or technology that millions of people use everyday without hassle, and tell those millions of people what a stinkin' piece of crap they've been unknowingly stuck with all this time. It's fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our subject of the day will be: the Macintosh keyboard. I know, it won a gazillion prizes for industrial design, it's the main human-interaction device for the most user-friendly OS in existence, it has a wonderful soft-touch feel, and it's on display in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, there's a bunch of symbols missing. I can empathize with the designer's wish for a clean and pure layout, and it looks &lt;strong&gt;awesome&lt;/strong&gt; in photographs, but googling "mac special characters" when you forget that ~ on an AZERTY keyboard is &amp;#x2325;-n-space gets old real quick. Of course everybody knows that tilde is mostly used in spanish for the letter 'Ã±', so that makes the &amp;#x2325;-n-space shortcut &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; intuitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of intuitiveness, what kind of sick deranged mind ever came up with the idea of Glyph Notation ? In case you don't know, glyph notation is the amusing practice of referring to special keys (in menus, documentation, even &lt;strong&gt;help&lt;/strong&gt; files) not by the key's name (conveniently written on the key itself) but with symbols that have absolutely no relation whatsoever with the key's name/shape/form/usage/history. For example, esc is &amp;#x238B;, ctrl is &amp;#x2303;, the option key (you know, the key with "alt" written on it) is &amp;#x2325; and the command key is &amp;#x2318;, which surprisingly &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; drawn on the key, along with a hollow apple that doesn't appear &lt;strong&gt;anywhere else&lt;/strong&gt;. (In case you're wondering: no, "command" isn't written anywhere on the keyboard.) Even though I get a real kick out of having a key with a hollow apple drawn on it, because it's cute and reminds me of the Apple IIc that introduced me to computing twenty years ago, I must admit that it doesn't make any kind of sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don't get me started on "enter" (&amp;#x2305;) and "return" (&amp;#x21A9;). There's a key with "enter" written on it, and another one with both "return" and "enter". (I believe that if I were to forget about the existence of the "enter" key I could get the same effect with fn-return, but it might be the other way around.) According to legends, old folk tales and post-it notes some guy claims to have seen on Steve Jobs' desktop, both keys have subtly different effects. I sure hope so, because they're taking up valuable keyboard real estate on my PowerBook G4, which is so small and optimized that it doesn't even have "insert" or "delete" keys. Very sad, considering "insert" has the outstanding quality that at least I know what the hell it's &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all those non-sensical gotchas in what I'll call (for lack of a better word), the "design" of the Mac Keyboard, Mac fans seem to love it. Self-described power users even brag about how much more powerful their keyboard shortcuts are because there's &lt;strong&gt;four&lt;/strong&gt; modifier keys on a Mac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who don't use both platforms regularly might not be aware of the subtle differences between them, so allow me to explain. &lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; reading the following paragraph might cause your brain to give up on you and move to Ecuador in search of better climate and a less life-deprived body. You've been warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PCs don't have the &lt;em&gt;ctrl&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;#x2303;) key. I mean, yeah, they have the &lt;em&gt;Ctrl&lt;/em&gt; key, (note the capital "C") but &lt;strong&gt;their&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ctrl&lt;/em&gt; key is really the equivalent of the &lt;em&gt;command&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;#x2318;) key, not &lt;em&gt;ctrl&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;#x2303;). So Windows PCs have three modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) and Macs have four (cmd, alt, ctrl, shift). Now I know some of you annoying smart asses are going to tell me that PCs have the AltGr key â€” which Macs don't have â€” but this doesn't really count, because AltGr is really Ctrl+Alt, so it's not an independent key. &lt;em&gt;[Update: Windows developer Deadly Smurf points out that it's possible for an application to distinguish between AltGr and Ctrl+Alt, although very few ever do, and having different behaviour in the two cases is generally considered bad design.]&lt;/em&gt; There's also the Windows key, but this is reserved for the OS (or seems to be. I've never seen it used by a client application) and is a joke anyway, the product of an underused mind somewhere at Microsoft, who one day looked at the space between "Ctrl" and "Alt" and thought "What a waste. Let's replace this useless empty space with a useless key, and make it do vaguely useful things in Windows 95". He brought it up to marketing, who immediately loved it, thinking that if by some off-chance the Briefcase failed to cause mass-adoption of the new OS, this "Windows key" certainly would. Last but not least, if anyone comes up with how the Mac's &lt;em&gt;ctrl&lt;/em&gt;  (&amp;#x2303;) is not needed on the PC because PC mouses have more than one button â€” on a Mac &lt;em&gt;ctrl-clic&lt;/em&gt; gets you a &lt;em&gt;right-click&lt;/em&gt;. Confused yet ? â€” I'll just have to take him outside and shoot him, because &lt;em&gt;ctrl&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;#x2303;) is used in keyboard shortcuts, so it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a full-fledged modifier key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now where was I ? Oh, yes. Mac power users. (Am I the only one who thinks of "power users" as "people who spend so much time customizing their computer and optimizing their settings and tweaking their applications and whatever that they never use their computer to actually &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; anything" ? Just wondering.) So, they're bragging about those four modifier keys. As if that was obviously a good thing. As if there really was such a dire need for more key combinations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever computed how many combinations you could get with three modifier keys ? I'm not very good at combinatorial arithmetics, but three keys should have as many states as a three bit register, which is, I think, eight. In any context where you're inputing text, using either no modifier key or &lt;em&gt;Shift&lt;/em&gt; alone will simply input the corresponding character. And &lt;em&gt;Alt&lt;/em&gt; is the menu key in Windows, so we're left with "only" five usable combinations for keyboard shortcuts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vast majority of Windows programs use &lt;em&gt;Ctrl&lt;/em&gt; for the really obvious stuff (Save / Close / etc.) and &lt;em&gt;Ctrl+Shift&lt;/em&gt; for the slightly less obvious stuff (Save As...), leaving &lt;strong&gt;three&lt;/strong&gt; other combinations for obscure functionalities and user-defined shortcuts. As a rule, most programs don't use &lt;em&gt;Alt-Shift&lt;/em&gt; nor &lt;em&gt;Ctrl-Alt-Shift&lt;/em&gt;, so this means that whenever you think a function is worthy of a keyboard shortcut but &lt;em&gt;Ctrl-&lt;/em&gt; is already taken, there's a good chance that &lt;em&gt;Ctrl-Shift-&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Ctrl-Alt-&lt;/em&gt; will be it. This is &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;. It means that most windows programs have very predictable keyboard shortcuts, and ease of use is all about predictability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on the Mac, not only do you have four modifiers but there's no designated menu key. (It's ctrl-F2. Which means ctrl-fn-F2 on laptops. Apple obviously thinks Mac OS' menu bar's mouse implementation is so fast that there's no reason to ever use the keyboard. Amazingly this is &lt;a href="http://www.asktog.com/columns/022DesignedToGiveFitts.html"&gt;mostly true&lt;/a&gt;.) This gives you &lt;strong&gt;fourteen&lt;/strong&gt; possible combinations for every key on the keyboard. Which is very impressive until you realize that you effectively have zero chance of ever guessing a keyboard shortcut you've not seen before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What compounds the problem is that beyond the really obvious (New/Open/Save/Close/Quit and clipboard ops) there's almost no convention for keyboard shortcuts across applications. Even really basic stuff like "move caret to beginning of current line" (the "caret" is the blinking vertical line that shows where you currently are in a document) can be either &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt; or &amp;#x2318;&amp;#x2190;. Move to next window/tab is either &amp;#x2318;&amp;tilde; (on US keyboards),  &amp;#x2318;&amp;gt; (on many other keyboards), &amp;#x2318;&amp;#x2192;, &amp;#x2325;&amp;#x21E5;, &amp;#x2318;&amp;#x2325;&amp;#x2192; &lt;br /&gt;or nothing (which means either use the mouse or &amp;#x2303;F2, W, &amp;#x2191;, something).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things don't have to be this way: application developers could just follow best practices and standardize on something sensible. "Sensible" doesn't mean "the best design possible in a world where no other application exists", but "the design which will make our application easiest to use for our target audience, given what programs they've used in the past and the habits they've acquired in so doing." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until this becomes widespread practice, user interface on the Mac will be a far cry from the total perfection described by fans.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7794980101972071820-644960315748206384?l=sboucher.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

			<description>Funny &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6568126976002236046"&gt;TED-talk by David Pogue&lt;/a&gt; about software design and simplicity, with a few geek songs thrown in for good measure. It's one more great example of how great speeches can be when the speaker has the courage to ditch PowerPoint.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7794980101972071820-1670817728292512181?l=sboucher.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

			<title>Stop levelling and start living!</title>
			<description>According to an &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/games/elves-trolls-and-deadly-danger/2007/02/04/1170523951389.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in The Age, many psychologists now agree that online games can lead to clinical addictions and other conditions classified as "mental health problems".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading this quote from a poster on the &lt;a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/WOW_widow/"&gt;WoW_Widow&lt;/a&gt; mailing-list, (I ripped of their slogan for the title of this post), I think I agree:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"My husband is addicted to WoW [World of Warcraft]. Our one-year anniversary is coming up in three weeks and he doesn't want to go anywhere for it because he won't get to play. I feel so neglected and he even turns me down for sex because he'd rather play the game ... I feel more like the mother of a 13-year-old boy than the wife of a 27-year-old man."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this somewhat-new phenomenon has lead enterprising individuals to seek new business opportunities, and that's alright, but... I wonder... who's going to buy &lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.com/gamerwidow.25300164"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;... and for whom ?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7794980101972071820-1144638498693801299?l=sboucher.blogspot.com'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
